MCP Server → API Scanner → Semantic Analysis → UI Generation → Artifact Management

Evaluation of semantic_stack-ui_generator and integration opportunities with the MCP server:
Capabilities
API scanning: OpenAPI/Swagger parsing, heuristic discovery, auth-aware probing, pattern detection (CRUD, RESTful, pagination), semantic manifest generation
UI generation: React components (DataTable, Form, DetailView), TypeScript, React Query hooks, API client generation, theme system (MUI, Ant Design, Tailwind), domain templates (SaaS, E-commerce, Healthcare, Finance)
CLI: generate, scan, init, generate-backend, generate-fullstack, generate-tests
Advanced: semantic manifest analysis, pattern comparison, marketplace scaffolding, backend generation (Express/FastAPI/NestJS), testing framework integration
Integration opportunities
New MCP tools:
api.scan — wrap the enhanced scanner
ui.generate — wrap the component generator
api.analyze — semantic manifest analysis
backend.generate — backend API generation
Workflow integration:
Shared infrastructure:
Artifact management for generated components
Transcript system for API analysis results
Role-based access control for generation tools
Rate limiting for API scanning operations
Value proposition
Developer experience: API → UI in one workflow, semantic analysis, domain-specific templates, full-stack generation
Enterprise features: multi-tenant support, RBAC, audit logging, compliance reporting
Advanced capabilities: AI-assisted generation, automated testing, performance optimization, deployment automation
Implementation strategy
Phase 1: Integrate core scanner and generator as MCP tools
Phase 2: Add semantic analysis and backend generation
Phase 3: Implement advanced features and marketplace integration
Phase 4: Add AI-powered enhancements and automation
Evaluate semantic_stack-ui_generator capabilities and integration potential with MCP server
Test API scanner functionality with real API endpoints
Identify specific integration points between semantic_stack and MCP server
Assess value proposition of combining both tools
Recommendation
Integrate semantic_stack-ui_generator with the MCP server. It adds API scanning and UI generation that complement the existing tools.
Immediate benefits:
API-to-UI workflow
Semantic analysis
Domain-specific templates
Full-stack generation
Strategic value:
Complete development automation
Enterprise-ready features
Extensible architecture
AI-ready foundation
The MCP server’s artifact management, role-based access control, and transcript system fit well with the generator’s scanning and generation capabilities. 1
