displayName: "Implementation Mission"

missionId: "B14.5-20251028"
objective: >
  Create a comprehensive end-to-end integration example demonstrating OSSP-AGI protocol utility.  
  Package as developer documentation with runnable examples.

context: |
  Builds on B14.1 through B14.4. Uses Integration Workbench to show real system interplay (API → Event → Data).  
  Final deliverable is a fully documented example repository section for external demonstration.

successCriteria:
  - "Published example runs via CLI with documented commands and expected outputs."
  - "Diagram exports (Draw.io + Cytoscape) accurate and linked in docs."
  - "Developer docs complete and linted for clarity and style."
  - "Example validated on macOS, Linux, Windows in CI."

deliverables:
  - "/app/examples/integration/workbench-demo.yaml"
  - "/app/docs/dev/examples/integration-demo.md"
  - "/app/tests/examples/integration-demo.test.ts"
  - "/app/artifacts/examples/integration-diagram.drawio"
