    - "draw.io exporter generates native .drawio (mxGraphModel) that opens in browser; style map applied"
    - "CLI: catalog list|view|generate-diagram with -o/--overwrite/--open; safe-by-default artifacts in /app/artifacts/diagrams/"
    - "Guardrails warn at ≥250 nodes or ≥5MB (Warning) and ≥400 nodes or ≥10MB (Critical); layer/split reduce output size/latency"
    - "Sprint summary generator writes /docs/sprints/sprint-13-summary.md using repository artifacts"

  # Sprint Success Metrics (Sprint 14)
  successMetrics_14:
    - "Integration Workbench orchestrates multi-protocol workflows (API → Event → Data) with p95 ≤ 2s @ ≤5 agents"
    - "Cytoscape.js viewer enables exploration of catalogs >250 nodes with stable 60fps interaction"
    - "Theme-style-schema.json externalized; Draw.io and Cytoscape themes in parity (light/dark)"
    - "CLI open-wrapper verified across macOS, Windows, and Linux; CI-safe by default"
