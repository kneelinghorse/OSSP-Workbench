missionId: "AM-20251004-001"

objective: "To define the high-level technical architecture, identify key components and dependencies, establish success metrics, and create a risk mitigation plan for the approved project."

context: |
  This mission is the first step in the Build Preparation Path, triggered by the 'Conditional Go' decision in mission <GNG-20251004-001>.
  It serves as the bridge between the 'why' (discovery) and the 'how' (development).

successCriteria:
  - "The technical approach is defined and key components are listed."
  - "The risk mitigation plan addresses the 'Biggest Risk' from the Level 4 Synthesis."
  - "Quantitative success metrics are defined."
  - "Initial high-level build missions for CMOS are generated."

deliverables:
  - "This completed architecture document."
  - "A high-level component diagram."
  - "A list of initial epics or tasks for the engineering backlog."

  sourceGoNoGoMission: "path/to/<problem-name>-go-no-go.yaml"
  
  validatedRequirements:
    - "System must allow filtering of audit logs by username and date range."
    - "Search query performance must be under 2 seconds (p95)."
    - "The solution must integrate with the existing Enterprise compliance dashboard."

  technicalSpecification:
    approach: "A new, standalone microservice ('AuditSearchService') responsible for ingesting and indexing log data. It will expose a REST API for the main application to query."
    database: "Elasticsearch for its powerful text search and aggregation capabilities."
    language: "Python (FastAPI), to align with existing backend services."

  riskMitigationPlan:
    - risk: "Underestimating the complexity of the search index, leading to performance issues and timeline slips." #
      mitigation: "Time-box a 3-day technical spike to build a proof-of-concept index with production-scale data. Define performance benchmarks before full implementation begins."

  successMetrics:
    - metric: "API query latency (p95)"
      target: "< 2 seconds"
    - metric: "Data ingestion lag"
      target: "< 5 minutes"
    - metric: "Service Uptime"
      target: "99.95%"

  cmosMissionGeneration:
    - "Create 'Setup Elasticsearch Cluster' mission."
    - "Create 'Develop Data Ingestion Pipeline' mission."
    - "Create 'Build AuditSearchService API' mission."
    - "Create 'Integrate API with Frontend' mission."
