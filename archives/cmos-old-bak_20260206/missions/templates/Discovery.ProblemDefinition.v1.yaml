missionId: "PD-20251004-002"

objective: "Produce a clear, evidence-backed problem statement that defines a specific actor, their broken workflow, and their desired outcome."

context: |
  This mission follows a successful Level 1 Opportunity Scan.
  Its purpose is to prevent the creation of generic solutions by forcing specificity about the actor and their actions.
  The time investment is 2-3 hours.

successCriteria:
  - "The 'actor' field identifies a specific, non-generic role."
  - "Every claim in the 'evidence' section has a cited source and strength rating."
  - "All three confidence scores are filled out with a justification for each."
  - "The output is a clear problem statement."

deliverables:
  - "This completed mission file."
  - "A one-sentence problem statement ready for wider communication."
