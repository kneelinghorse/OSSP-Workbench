missionId: "RO-20251004-001"

objective: "To successfully manage and complete five parallel research missions, ensuring that comprehensive, multi-dimensional evidence is gathered for the Level 4 Go/No-Go Synthesis."

context: |
  This mission is triggered after a successful Level 2 Problem Definition. It is the core evidence-gathering phase of the Progressive Discovery Framework.
  The principle of parallel execution is critical to prevent confirmation bias and create a diverse set of findings.
  The output of this mission is the primary input for the Level 4 decision.

successCriteria:
  - "All five defined sub-missions are moved to a 'Completed' status."
  - "Each completed sub-mission file is linked correctly in the 'subMissions' list."
  - "The entire research phase is completed within the 6-hour time box."

deliverables:
  - "A collection of five completed and validated Research Sub-Mission files."
