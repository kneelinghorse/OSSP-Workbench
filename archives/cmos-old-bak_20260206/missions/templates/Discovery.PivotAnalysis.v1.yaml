# Mission File: <original-problem>-pivot.yaml

missionId: "PA-20251004-001"

objective: "To formulate and validate a new, evidence-backed hypothesis by re-examining the findings from the previous research cycle."

context: |
  This mission is triggered by the Level 4 Synthesis mission <GNG-20251004-001>, which resulted in a 'Pivot/Refine' decision.
  Pivoting is a crucial, healthy part of the discovery process, preventing investment in a suboptimal direction.

successCriteria:
  - "The new hypothesis is clearly articulated."
  - "Existing evidence from prior research is mapped to the new hypothesis."
  - "A final decision to 'Restart at Level 2' or 'Abandon' is made and justified."

deliverables:
  - "This completed pivot analysis."
  - "If restarting, a new Level 2: Problem Definition mission is created."

  # The key insight that invalidated the original hypothesis or revealed a new opportunity.
  pivotTrigger: "Finding from R2: Solution Landscape mission showed that while users aren't willing to pay for another filtering tool, three competitors have recently been acquired for their data aggregation capabilities, a feature our system could easily support."

  newHypothesis: "Instead of a search tool, users will pay for a 'compliance dashboard' that aggregates and visualizes audit data from multiple sources, as this is a higher-value, unsolved problem for our target persona."

  # Re-use existing research to test the new hypothesis quickly.
  evidenceMapping:
    - originalFinding: "Users are exporting data to analyze in Excel."
      relevanceToNewHypothesis: "Supports the need for data aggregation and visualization, not just search."
    - originalFinding: "Budget holders acknowledge the cost of manual compliance."
      relevanceToNewHypothesis: "The cost is still valid, but the value is in the dashboard/reporting, not the underlying search."

  knowledgeGaps:
    - "What specific data sources need to be aggregated?"
    - "What are the most critical visualizations for a compliance dashboard?"

  # The explicit exit gate for the pivot.
  decision: "Restart at Level 2" # Restart at Level 2 | Abandon
  justification: "The new hypothesis is supported by several key findings from the original research and aligns better with observed market trends (competitor acquisitions). A new Level 2 mission is required to define the 'Compliance Dashboard' problem specifically."
