missionId: "GNG-20251004-001"

objective: "To synthesize all evidence from the Level 3 research phase into a scored decision and define the immediate next action."

context: |
  This mission is the final step in the core Progressive Discovery Framework.
  It consumes the outputs of the five research sub-missions managed by orchestrator <RO-20251004-001>.
  The numerical scoring forces an honest, evidence-based assessment and creates an auditable decision record.

successCriteria:
  - "All four scoring dimensions are completed with a score and justification."
  - "The final decision (Stop, Pivot, Conditional Go, Strong Go) is explicitly stated."
  - "If the decision is 'Go', the 'nextSteps' section is fully completed."

deliverables:
  - "This completed decision record."

  # The scoring framework from your roadmap.
  scoringDimensions:
    - dimension: "1. Problem Validation"
      keyEvidence: "R1 findings show high frequency of complaints and costly workarounds. R5 confirms budget holders acknowledge the cost."
      justification: "The evidence for a real, painful problem is overwhelming and confirmed by multiple sources."
      score: 9 # 0-10

    - dimension: "2. Solution Feasibility"
      keyEvidence: "R3 confirms the required data is available via internal APIs. R2 shows no competitor has a truly elegant solution, suggesting it's non-trivial but achievable."
      justification: "Technical risk is moderate. We have the core capabilities but will need to invest in a performant search index."
      score: 7 # 0-10
      
    - dimension: "3. Market Readiness"
      keyEvidence: "R4 indicates a shift to stricter compliance (SOX, GDPR) is driving demand. R2 shows competitors are focused elsewhere."
      justification: "The timing is excellent. Regulatory pressure creates a 'must-have' need, and the competitive landscape has a clear gap."
      score: 9 # 0-10
      
    - dimension: "4. Economic Viability"
      keyEvidence: "R5 shows current spending on workarounds (hiring extra staff) is >$50k/year for large clients. Willingness to pay for a solution is high."
      justification: "Clear ROI for the customer. Potential to price this as an add-on to our Enterprise plan. Unit economics look promising."
      score: 8 # 0-10

  finalScore: 33 # /40
  
  # The final decision gate.
  decision: "Conditional Go" # Stop (<20) | Pivot/Refine (20-28) | Conditional Go (28-35) | Strong Go (35+)
  
  # Defines the path forward.
  nextSteps:
    ifGo:
      criticalSuccessFactor: "The search query performance must be under 2 seconds to be better than the manual workaround."
      biggestRisk: "Underestimating the complexity of the search index, leading to timeline slips."
      nextImmediateAction: "Initiate a Level 5B: Architecture Mission to define the technical specification and create a time-boxed technical spike for the search index."
